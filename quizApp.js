//We're going to create the JS for a basic quiz application. 

//Let's think about the nature of this quiz app first. We're going to be creating lots of user objects, and we're
//also going to be creating lots of Question objects. Those would make two perfectly good constructors. 

//Create a User constructor that accepts name, email, password, and totalScore paramters and set them appropriatly

  //code here


//Create a Question constructor that accepts title, answersArray, rightAnswer, and difficulty paramters

  //code here


//Create a users Array which is going to hold all of our users.

  //code here


//Let's say three people signed up for our service, create 3 intances of User and add each to the users Array

  //code here


//Create a questions Array which is going to hold all of our questions

  //code here


//Now, let's say we wanted to create a quiz about JavaScript. Create three instances of Question which contain the following data
//title: 'T/F: Inheritance is achieved in JavaScript through Prototypes?'
//title: 'T/F: JavaScript is just a scripting version of Java'
//title: "T/F: In Javascript, == doesn't check 'type' but just the value - where === checks type and value"
//Fill in the rest of the required data as you see appropriate.

  //code here


//Now push all of your instances of Question into the questions Array

  //code here

console.log('My users Array and my questions arrray are ...');
//Now loop console.log your users array and your questions array and verify that they're both holding the right data.

  //code here
